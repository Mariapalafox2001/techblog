	<h2>The end of humanity is near...when, right now</h2>
	<h3>By Maria Palafox</h3>

	<p>In the video, called "Humans Need Not Apply" talks about the topic of robots'  increasing through human society, explaining how  how robots will lead to a future where human labor is no longer needed. In the video an analogy is made by comparing how humans once replaced horses from their jobs, by creating cars, symbolising that humans will always find new work, showing how horses are not nearly as much used now. Then it shows how robots are doing the same with humans, meaning that robots are now replacing human labor. The video also discusses how economics is based upon automation for the future. It is also stated that 45% of the workforce could be replaced by robots, and higher than the 25% unemployment figure of the Great Depression.  Also even creative occupations are not secure.
 </p>
	<p>There are pros and cons of having robots in the workplace. The pros are that robots are way cheaper than humans. The robots do not get payed for their labor, they just do what they are programed to do. Also they have more energy than humans, meaning that robots don't get tired as humans.Robots, in the workplace would be a good advantage beacuse robots of different sizes would work in places where humans cna't be. The cons of having robots in the workpalce are that human labor would not be required any more and humans would be unemployed. And Robots can easily be hacked.</p>

		<h3> Good Job </h3>

		<p>I really liked the way you presented all of this information, although the dark blue behind black text makes it harder to read, it is detailed and shows your reaction to the video.</p>

		<p>I like the way you portrayed how robots are taking over human jobs. Good ideas presented. Colors are a little overwhelming for my eyes though.</p>

	<h2>Blown to Bits</h2>
	<h3>By Maria Palafox</h3>
	<img src="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/themes/blown-to-bits/images/hands.jpg">
<p>In the small passage footprints and fingerprints, is about how our fingerprints and footprints in the digital world can be used to hack the privacy of a person.Fingerprints are left every where a person touches and someone can use those fingerprints for bad deeds like stealing money, identity theft etc.</p>
<p>In the passage called smile while we snap is about how a picture can be used to find a person in a short span. Also a picture posted online can be good and bad for a person, meaning that it could destroy a persons reputation or help it.   </p>
<p>In "knowing where we are" is about how a gps can help locate objects and persons.</p>
<p>This book focuses on the tracking devices such as the GPS tracking systems and others. These systems sometimes help people find their ways, but these systems are also used mainly to track people also. These tracking systems can sometimes help us find the most valuable items and it can sometimes lead to a mystery because even criminals can use these systems to track people, which van be very dangerous. This chapter then talks about how people can find information about the government and other jobs using these. Also, this chapter talk about how dangerous it can be to share private information in the computer.</p>

	<h2>Tech interview</h2>
	<h3>By Maria Palafox</h3>
	<img src="https://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/tech-obsessed-584.jpg">
	<img src="">
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: How old were you when got your first computer?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cyaetano: I never had a computer as a kid. My family didn't have the money for luxury items but we had a comfortable life.</p>
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: What was your favorite technology growing up?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cayetano: Like I mention before I never had technology growing up, but what we did for fun was do paper airplaines, boats, kites, board games, watch the T.V or do work on the field.</p>
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: Hows has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cayetano: Technology didn't really affect me since my technology wasn't that advance, also cause it was too expensive to have, but because of this the technology of today is hard for me  to understand.</p>
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly help or hurt society?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cayetano: I would say that technolgy have helped and hurt society at the same time, cause with out technolgy we wouldn't be able to do what we do today, technology made life easy. But because we have technology, its making society lazy, especially the youth. The youth is more focus on their phones then their enviorment. The youth is being more dependable on technology, that I wonder what would the youth be like if technology was to one day disappear?</p>
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cayetano: My hope is that technology can somehow help society grow to be active and not lazy.</p>
	<p class="Mary_lines">Maria Palafox: What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>
	<p>Silvia Cayetano: My greatest fear for technology would be that technology would one day have a mind of it's own and tries to get rid of us.</p>

		<h3> Nice </h3>
		<h4> Samantha</h4>
		<p> This interview is really detailed and has a lot of information. The way you differentiated between you and the person you were interviewing using colors and the italics really improves the style of the page. </p>
